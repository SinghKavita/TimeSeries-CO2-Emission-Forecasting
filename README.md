Business  Problem:
COâ‚‚ Emission Forecasting from U.S. Electric Power Sector using SARIMA

Workflow:
	â€¢ Data exploration and visualization of monthly COâ‚‚ emissions from natural gas usage.
	â€¢ Stationarity checks using ADF tests and transformations (differencing, smoothing).
	â€¢ Seasonal decomposition and exponential weighted moving averages.
	â€¢ Hyperparameter tuning with grid search for SARIMA/SARIMAX modeling.
	â€¢ Model evaluation using AIC, RMSE, and dynamic forecasting.
	â€¢ Final 10-year emission forecasts with confidence intervals for long-term analysis.

ðŸ“ˆ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, SARIMA, SARIMAX
